# Enhanced 3D Solar System

An interactive, **3D Solar System simulation** built with **Three.js** and **GSAP**. Explore the planets, their orbits, and enjoy interactive features like adjustable speeds, camera focus, and theme toggles.



## 🌟 Features

- **3D Planetary Orbits**: Realistic elliptical orbits with eccentricity for each planet.
- **Interactive Planet Controls**: Adjust orbit speed dynamically with sliders.
- **Camera Focus**: Focus on any planet using the dropdown menu.
- **Click to Zoom**: Smoothly zoom the camera to any planet by clicking on it.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over planets to see their names.
- **Orbit Path Toggle**: Show or hide the orbit paths of planets.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between dark space and light sky backgrounds.
- **Reset View**: Reset the camera to the default view.
- **Starfield Background**: Realistic stars to enhance space experience.
- **Saturn Rings**: Special ring for Saturn for realism.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - 3D rendering engine for WebGL.
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - Smooth animations (camera zoom, transitions).
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Core web technologies.



## 🎨 Demo
